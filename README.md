# calculator-js
This is a simple calculator example in html and js

# Excercise:
1. Finish in javascript all the functions of the calculator
2. add 3 buttons at the bottom and style them - when clicking each one the stlye of the calculator will change:
- color
- font
- etc.
3. upload your calculator to github. deploy it and send the link


# git hub and git (optional but recommended)

try to work with github while making changes 

1. by uploading the files to github directly. you can upload each time you change and commit.

2. terminal - GIT terminal commands:
git init - one time only needed at the root of your project
git add . - adds all files (dont forget the . after add)
git commit -am "[your commit message]"
git branch -M main - one time only command
git remote add origin https://github.com/[replace with your repo and profile example:ranerlich7/rita_sample2.git] - one time only command
git push -u origin main - next time you can just git push
